# Decisions & Inputs

## Vendor Data Source
- Keep existing `vendor` CPT as canonical when present; provide compatibility layer.
- Suggested/auto-detected ACF/meta: `email`, `phone`, `products`, `inside_outside`, `power_needed`, `tables_count`, `notes`.

## Seasons & Recurrence
- Weekly Saturdays.
- Historically Summer (May–Oct) 8–12, Indoor (Nov–Apr) 9–12 — **must remain flexible**.

## Booths & Pricing
- 5 ft and 10 ft widths; multiples of 10 up to 5 tables total.
- Track "needs power". Inside vs. outside zones.
- Pricing is admin-controlled per season/zone (no hardcoding).

## Applications
- Categories/add-ons configurable per season.

## Payments
- Square first (Checkout only initially).

## Docs & Compliance
- Admin-definable doc types (COI, W‑9, permits); expirations and reminders.

## Communications
- Email only for now; from `wordpress@glensfallsfarmersmarket.com`.

## Accounting
- QuickBooks optional; CSV first.

## Analytics
- Defer for now.

## AI Assistants
- Application summaries, comms drafting, data hygiene.
